          <div class="item item2"><p> <br><br>I have been interested in electonics and computers for sometime. My dad worked at Atari in shipping when I was young. <br>
          In high school, I took drafting and later attended vocational school for credits in electronic test and assembly.<br>
          In my twenties, I worked at Atari as well, but with my background I was working on the assembly line. <br>
          After a few years, I started working in the troubleshooting area, fixing and making repairs as needed for QA approval. <br>
          Afterward, I worked installing x-ray machines throughout Califorina, mostly for chiropractors and veterinarians. <br>
          I left the electronic field and worked at San Jose Unified School District as a custodian. <br>
          It was at this time I had my first PC and found America Online for the first time. I found a Star Trek chat room <br>
          and just chatted and role played at all hours. I met my best friend there and though we didn't like each other to at first, <br>
          we have now been married over 19 years. We have two wonderful redhead little girls who are 12 and almost 8. <br>
          We like to tease them and say if it wasn't for Star Trek, they wouldn't be here. <br>
          My wife is a teacher. We made a promise to each other years ago when we first got married that once she had a steady job, <br>
          I would quit my job and go after my dreams.<br>
          So a few months ago with my wife's blessing, I quit my job of almost 20 years to pursue my passions. <br><br>
          Now it's my turn! </p>
