        <h2>Now it's my turn</h2>

        <p> I have been interested in electonics and computers for sometime. My dad worked at Atari in shipping while I was young. In hihg school I took drafing and later vocational school for credits in electronc test and assembly.Later I worked at Atari as well, but with my background I was working on the assembly line and later on the troubleshooting area. Fixing and making repairs as needed for QA approval. Forterwords I worked installing X-Ray machines thoughout Califorina, mostly for charopractors and veternarians.
            I left the electronic field for a while as I worked at San Jose Unified School District as a custodian. 
            It was at this time I had my first PC and went online on AOL for the first time. Found a Star Trek chat room and just chatter and roll played for all hours. I met my best friend there and though we didn't like eachother to beginwith, we have now been married over 19 years. We have two wonderful red head little girls almost 8 and one is now 12. We like to kid them and say if it wasn't for Star Trek, they wouldn't be here. My wife is a teacher and it has been a promise we made eachother years ago when we first got married that once she has a great job, I can quit my job and go after my dreams.
            So a few months ago with my wifes blessing I quit my job of almost 20 years to go after my own dreams. Now it's my turn! </p>
