          <div class="item item2"><p> <br><br>I have been interested in electonics and computers for sometime. My dad worked at Atari in shipping while I was young. <br>
          In high school I took drafting and later vocational school for credits in electronc test and assembly.<br>
          Later while in my twenties I worked at Atari as well, but with my background I was working on the assembly line. <br>
          After a few years I started working in the troubleshooting area. Fixing and making repairs as needed for QA approval. <br>
          Afterwords I worked installing X-Ray machines thoughout Califorina, mostly for charopractors and veternarians. <br>
          I left the electronic field for a while as I worked at San Jose Unified School District as a custodian. <br>
          It was at this time I had my first PC and went online on AOL for the first time. Found a Star Trek chat room <br>
          and just chatter and roll played for all hours. I met my best friend there and though we didn't like eachother to at first, <br>
          we have now been married over 19 years. We have two wonderful red head little girls almost 8 and one is now 12. <br>
          We like to kid them and say if it wasn't for Star Trek, they wouldn't be here. <br>
          My wife is a teacher and it has been a promise we made each other years ago when we first got married that once she has a great job, <br>
          I can quit my job and go after my dreams.<br>
          So a few months ago with my wifes blessing I quit my job of almost 20 years to go after my own dreams. <br><br>
          Now it's my turn! </p>
